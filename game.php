    On January 29th 2003 the first Keptosh game was released. Created using  <a href="http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/">Adventure Game Studio</a> the game received praise from members of the AGS community. It was nominated for Best Game and Best Sound/Music in the <a href="http://www.adventuregamers.com/display.php?id=339">2003 AG Underground Awards</a>. The game was favorably <a href="http://www.adventuregamers.com/article/id,279">reviewed</a> by Dave Gilbert.</p>

<p>Keptosh 1.0 featured the Character Control System Plug-in by Scorpiorus which allowed non-player characters to move about the environment in what appeared to be their daily activities. Combined with the soundtrack and setting this made a rather simple game very immersive for some.</p>

    <p>It is the year 2084.</p> 
    
    <p>You live in ServaCor city. The city is ruled by the massive corporation called ServaCor. Humans have come to rely on electricity and data to sustain their lives. The slang term of "junc and flow" has been given to these two vices. ServaCor supplies junc to the entire city, while flow is gathered from a Lunar based computer network.</p>
    
    <p>Most citizens of ServaCor and the millions of other cities just like it hate their rulers. The corporations provide the citizens with free food, beer, shelter, junc, and flow in exchange for what is almost slave labor in huge robot factories. Most people are not happy with their situation, they see these "free" provisions as thinly masked ways to keep the citizens in line.</p>
    
    <p>Welcome to the future.</p> 
    
    <p>You are Adis Keptosh.</p>

    <p>Keptosh 1.0 has been downloaded via the AGS website over 2500 times. Although it has seen considerable success for the small project it was intended to be it was plagued with several problems. A major concern after development became the fact that the game was tied to the Microsoft Windows Operating System due to the use of the CCS plugin. The game also was criticized for poorly designed puzzles and repetition of much of the music. Some people criticized the graphics, claiming that they were ugly. This is a criticism often given to fan games that follow the classic 1980's Sierra graphic style and even the original Sierra games themselves.</p>
    <p>Keptosh 1.0 was released as an <a href="downloads/Keptosh1FULL_source.zip">open source resource</a> for the AGS community.</p>
    <h3><a href="downloads/Keptosh2DEMO_source.zip">Keptosh version 2.0</a></h3>
    <p><a href="downloads/Keptosh2DEMO_source.zip"><img src="images/kep_game2.png" border="1" width="75" height="118" alt="Keptosh 2.0 Main Character" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5" /></a>Following some of the comments regarding Keptosh 1.0 it was quickly decided to attempt to update the graphics and puzzles. The game drew more graphical inspiration from LucasArts titles than from Sierra ones. The development process was poorly planned and the project failed as a result. While all of the required backgrounds for the game were completed the characters were not.</p>
    <p>Keptosh 2.0 saw some restructuring of the overall story. It also condensed much of the original story into one area. This was intended to leave room for a journey to the Lunar base so that Adis could extract revenge for the death of Nessa Jussox. Nessa's death was left out of Keptosh 1.0 so that the game would have a slightly more ambiguous ending.</p>
    <h3>Keptosh version 3.0</h3>
    <p><img src="images/kep_game3.png" alt="Keptosh 3.0 Main Character" width="100" height="175" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="left" />
    Challenges encountered during the development of version 2.0 led to scaling back the graphics ambitions to a style more reminiscent of Sierra's AGI era graphics. Where Keptosh 1.0 had followed a slightly modified SCI inspired style 3.0 would bring the character art problem down to a more manageable level.</p> 
    <p>At the first inception of 3.0 the overall story had become epic in scale. Traversing several worlds and ending in the death of Adis. Once again the scale of an aspect of the game got in the way. The project never even made it to the planning stages.</p>
    
    <p>This project is considered to be currently in a prolonged pre-production phase. No backgrounds have been designed and the story is still awaiting a rewrite. While all of the characters have been drawn it is likely that they will change. It is likely that Keptosh 3.0 will follow a very different story line than the original version. As a result, even what little is done will most likely be revised.</p>
