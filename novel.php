The core of the Keptosh franchise is the novel. Adis Keptosh started as a secondary character in a Novel and has grown into much more. Keptosh combines several novel writing theories together as a way of constructing a novel.

At the heart of the process is Joseph Campbell's <em>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</em>. It is from here that the basic outline is constructed. Taking the Heroes Journey and fleshing it out more is the Dramatica Theory of Story. This theory comes from <em>Dramatica: A New Thoery of Story</em> by Melanie Anne Phillips and Chris Huntley. Using this book and the counterpart software <em>The Writer's Dreamkit</em> the characters and story are given elements needed to be more dynamic. Simplifying all of this story and bringing it to back to its roots is Christopher Vogler's <em>The Writer's Journey</em>. Finally the capstone tool is Robert J. Ray's <em>The Weekend Novelist (First Edition)</em>. With this work a solid timeline is layed out for the novels construction.

As is always the problem with so many tools at ones disposal you can find yourself overwhelmed with playing with the toys and not moving forward. The Keptosh novel has  been a victim of this pitfall. However, without these tools it would have simply been a poorly written novel, rather than no novel at all. Which some may feel is not any better. These tools have forced Keptosh to be constantly rethought as weaknesses have been uncovered in the story.
