The Keptosh Adventure Game was nominated for Best Sound/Music in the 2003 AG Underground Awards. As a result there was always a desire to expand that music into a full fledged soundtrack.
<br /><br />
    
The soundtrack is an experimental electronic piece with each track representing a major step in the story. The soundtrack itself follows its own hero's journey.
